# weather-monitoring
In this we had developed a smart device using IOT to remotely monitor the weather.
The device uses the following Things...
  1. NodeMCU Microcontroller
  2. DHT11 Sensor
  3. MQ135 Sensor
  4. 16 X 2 LCD Display
  5. I2C Module

Also we have used ThinkSpeak Cloud for remote monitoring of the data and visualize using graphs.
We can further use this to predict the weather using Machine Learning Algorithm.
We can simply download CSV file from ThingSpeak.
